/**
 * Namespaces allow you to organize your code better. They are useful when
 * using or writing libraries.
 *
 * Before namespace support was added to PHP, namespaces were achieved by
 * prefixing all class names and variables. For example, PEAR_Date, SwatDate
 * Console_CommandLine, Crypt_GPG_Process, etc.
 *
 * Prefixing is undesireable because it makes class names long, or encourages
 * nameing schemes which can cause conflicts between projects. Both these
 * reduce code readability and long class names can reduce code writability.
 *
 * Nammespacing support in PHP logically seprates the namespace from the
 * class name and allows you as the developer to control when and where
 * to use prefixes in your code.
 *
 * The namespace operator in PHP is \. This operator was selected after a lot
 * of debate. It was selected because it is easy to type and is a new symbol
 * for the PHP parser. The existing symbols :: or . could not be used because
 * they would result in parser ambiguity with existing PHP language features.
 *
 * You can only define one namespace in a single file. The examples for this
 * feature are contained in a subdirectory.
